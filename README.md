In my bubbles modification, I had enlarged the size of the bubble while darkening the background of the composition. I also edited the positioning of the bubble through x and y. More specifically, through the coding of x += random (-1,3) and y += random (-1,3). Although I am not entirely certain of its pattern, the bubble obviously shifts its direction. Previously, one of the computer mouse functions were "ifMousePressed" however I had changed it to "mouseButton" which allows me to move the bubble by simply hovering over it instead of needing to click anything.
